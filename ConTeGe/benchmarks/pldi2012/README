Fully Automatic and Precise Detection of Thread Safety Violations
by Michael Pradel and Thomas R. Gross
PLDI 2012
=================================================================

This package contains 15 bugs that we used to evaluate our PLDI 2012 paper.
To reproduce the bugs, please use JDK 1.6.0_27 (except for "XStream", which
is only reproducible with JDK 1.6.0_07).

For each bug, there is a folder containing:
- a .jar file of the program under test (in /jar)
- .jar files for third-party libraries required by the program under test
  (in /lib)
- a test that triggers the bug (in /src)
- a test runner that repeatedly invokes the test (in /src)

If a bug is triggered, the test prints the stack trace or the VM's deadlock
information, and then the program terminates.

Two bugs do not have any .jar files because they are bugs in JDK 1.6.0_27.

The XSeries bugs requires JDK 1.6.0_07.

Each bug folder is a separate Eclipse project that you can import into
Eclipse (tested with Eclipse 3.5.2).

The tests are similar to those generated by our implementation but have been 
simplified to be easier to understand. Each test only reports a particular kind
of exception to avoid reporting exceptions that can also occur in linearizations
of the tests. Our implementation does this filtering automatically.
