== Program ==
JDK 1.1

== Class ==
java.io.BufferedInputStream

== Note ==
The source code of the classes from JDK 1.1 that are relevant for the
bug are in java11_src.tar.gz. We rename the package to avoid conflicts
with the real Java runtime.
We couldn't access the original source code for JDK 1.1 and
therefore re-introduced the bug into the source code of JDK
1.2, based on the description of the bug in the PhD thesis
of Aaron Greenhouse (CMU, page 39).

== Stack trace that exposes the bug ==
